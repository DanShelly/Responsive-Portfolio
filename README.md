# Responsive-Portfolio
This is a recreated version of the portfolio that is responsive to different screen sizes and behaves according to the screen shots provided as a guide. This version uses bootstrap to create the vast majority of style changes, and does so in a way that allows the website to adapt to the changing screen size.
